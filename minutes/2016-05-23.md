## Contributor CLA

Still to do.

## Discuss research report

Will come in due time.

## Issues

Bugs can be reported at Yellowgras.

### Dynsem rewrite introduces issues

Vlad is present this week, so issues could (should) be resolved face to face.

### Spoofax casts Apache FileObjects back to java.io.File

Workaround is to create real files in ~/.cache (or whatever), which can easily
be turned into a temp file when Spoofax works.
