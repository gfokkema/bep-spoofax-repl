# Client meeting 2016-05-12

Demo of the first sprint (2016-05-05 - 2016-05-12). This is the only one week
sprint due to having needed more time to resolve Hendrik's comments on
the research report. From now on, all sprints will be two weeks long.

## Agenda

1. Demo of the console-based REPL with paplj, simpl and icedust:
  * Show whole program
  * Show single expressions
  * Show :parse, :analyze, :help, :exit
  * Show session history
2. Questions from us:
  * Does the Eclipse plugin need to be standalone, or should it be integrated
    into spoofax-eclipse?
  * IPython kernel as a solution to literate programming, or an own custom
    solution?

## Notes

* Some languages don't define an analysis phase.
* "runstrat" is hardcoded.

## Minutes

* Standalone jar with all dependencies included
* One might want to store an expression, as a "current term".
* Next steps:
  * Evaluation in context.
  * Make the REPL more robust.
  * Within spoofax-eclipse? Question should be discussed with GabriÃ«l.
  * Syntax highlighting in input buffer.
* Eclipse plugin? Just a terminal is sufficient?
  * Bind Spoofax instance of repl to the one in Eclipse.
  * Interaction with Eclipse.
  * REPL loads the active language.
* "Load" command for a language.
  * Then it becomes more of a REPL for Spoofax itself too.
* IPython kernel and Jupyter notebooks.
  * Experiment with it, it sounds interesting.
