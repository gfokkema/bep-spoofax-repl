\section{ESV extensions}
\label{sec:esv-extensions}

REPL-specific extensions have been made available to the ESV configuration
language (see \cref{ssec:editor-serv}) to configure language-specific
features. Currently, the backend used to specify the dynamic semantics of a
language (see \cref{sec:eval-strat}) and the start symbols valid within the
context of a REPL can be configured. The newly added configuration settings are
illustrated in \cref{lst:eval-method}. After loading a language that defines
these additional settings, they will be available through Spoofax's API as a
\texttt{``ShellFacet''}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=esv,caption={Configuring language specific settings.},label={lst:eval-method}]
module editor/SL-Shell

shell
    evaluation method : "dynsem"
    shell start symbol : Expr
    command prefix : ":"
\end{lstlisting}

This ESV configuration can be extended in the future to allow the specification
of language-specific additional commands, as discussed in
\cref{ssec:lang-spec-addit}.
