\section{ESV extensions}
\label{sec:esv-extensions}

REPL-specific extensions have been made available to the ESV language to
configure language specific features. Currrently, the backend used to specify
the dynamic semantics of a language (see \cref{sec:eval-strat}) and the start
symbols valid within the context of a REPL can be configured. The newly added
configuration settings are illustrated in \cref{lst:eval-method}. After loading
a language that defines these additional settings, they will be available via
the ShellFacet.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=esv,caption={Configuring language specific settings.},label={lst:eval-method}]
module editor/SL-Shell

shell
    evaluation method : "dynsem"
    shell start symbol : Expr
    command prefix : ":"
\end{lstlisting}

This ESV configuration can be extended in the future to allow the specification
of language-specific additional commands, as discussion in
\cref{ssec:lang-spec-addit}.
