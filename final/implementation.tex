\chapter{Implementation}
\label{cha:implementation}

The previous chapter described the design of the product. During the
implementation of this design, issues surfaced that had not been foreseen. This
chapter discusses these issues and the changes made to the design to resolve
them. \Cref{sec:dynsem-eval-strat} illustrates the implementation of the
evaluation strategy for DynSem. \Cref{sec:esv-extensions} explains the
extensions that have been made to Spoofax's editor services to enable the
language designer to configure and extend the REPL for their language.
\Cref{sec:injection} highlights the use of dependency injection via the Guice
framework. Finally, \Cref{sec:frontends} discusses the implementation of the
console and Eclipse frontends.
