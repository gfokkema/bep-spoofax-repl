\section{Language interpreters have to be on the classpath}
\label{sec:classpath}

In \cref{sec:dynsem-eval-strat} the implementation of the DynSem evaluation
strategy was outlined, together with its backend, the Truffle VM.  From the
DynSem specification of a language an interpreter can be generated, which uses
Truffle's \texttt{``PolyglotEngine''} for its implementation.

As any other Truffle language, the language of the interpreter has to be
registered with Truffle by annotating it correctly\footnote{See:
\url{http://lafo.ssw.jku.at/javadoc/truffle/latest/com/oracle/truffle/api/TruffleLanguage.Registration.html}}.
DynSem generates this annotation for languages defined in Spoofax, after which
the \texttt{PolyglotEngine} finds and registers all annotated languages when it
is instantiated. However, according to the Truffle specification, the
PolyglotEngine will \textit{``search for languages registered in the system class
loader and make them available for later evaluation\footnote{See:
\url{http://lafo.ssw.jku.at/javadoc/truffle/latest/com/oracle/truffle/api/vm/PolyglotEngine.html}}''}.

As a consequence, interpreters for languages to be used inside the REPL need to
be on the classpath of the system classloader before instantiating a
\texttt{PolyglotEngine}, which implies that a REPL user should specify the path to
the desired language interpreter before starting the REPL. Since Truffle
enforces the use of the system classloader, attempts to load the
\texttt{PolyglotEngine} using a custom classloader unfortunately did not solve this
issue. It is suspected that this issue will become apparent in Spoofax as well as the new
DynSem implementation is integrated more tightly.
