\section{Partial Program Evaluation}
\label{sec:wrapping}

During the research phase of the project, the investigated solutions to the
problem of partial program evaluation were primarily focused on ``wrapping'' an
incomplete program such that it becomes a valid program as a whole, as the
OpenJDK team has done for JShell (see \cref{ssec:a-execution-model-repl}). A
solution using templates for various language constructs was proposed to keep
this approach generic across all languages supported by Spoofax.
\Cref{fig:wrapping} shows a diagram which describes this idea. The diagram shows
the wrapping of both the environment definitions and the incomplete program AST.
The environment definitions, in this case, refer to the language-specific
constructs such as class definitions, function definitions and variable
declarations.

However, as the project developed and the entry point to DynSem was refactored
(see \cref{sec:dynsem-refactor}), wrapping turned out to be an
unnecessary and inadequate solution for two reasons. Firstly, the ability to
invoke a rule corresponding to any AST, both complete and incomplete,
automatically allows for evaluating incomplete programs without wrapping them
first to form a complete program. Secondly, due to the ability to pass the
semantic components as arguments to a reduction rule, the need of wrapping the
environment definitions (such as functions and variables) became unnecessary
too.

The custom start symbol as described in \cref{sec:esv-extensions} together with
the REPL-specific rules used to obtain and pass execution contexts to DynSem
then already results in a fully functional REPL, without the need to wrap
partial programs inside predefined templates.
