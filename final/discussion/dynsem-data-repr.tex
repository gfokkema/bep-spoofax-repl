\section{DynSem Data Types for Rule Results}
\label{sec:dynsem-data-repr}
The data type of the results of the invocation of a reduction rule, are
currently just \texttt{Object}. The actual type of the semantic components is
unknown, as a semantic component can be of any type defined in the DynSem
specification.

As such, it is hard to perform operations such as printing on the returned
data. One could simply call the \texttt{``toString''} method, but often more
control is needed. For example if one wants to provide a graphical view of the
environment in the form of a tree structure, this solution is inadequate.

Furthermore, there is at the time of writing an open issue in DynSem to support
conversion of its internal term representation to a Stratego term
representation. The result of an evaluation can then be treated just as any
other Stratego term, giving more control to the frontend in deciding how to
present the result to the user.
