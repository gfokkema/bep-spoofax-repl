\section{Refactoring DynSem's Entry Point}
\label{sec:dynsem-refactor}
During the project, the implementation of DynSem had changed significantly:
instead of letting the generated interpreters be defined on their own, they now
use the Truffle language implementation framework for their
implementation~\cite{Humer14}. Due to this change, the interface of the entry
points of the generated interpreters changed as well.

Initially, the only available rule was the ``main'' rule for evaluating complete
programs, rather than any rule. Furthermore, the evaluation of a program was
tied to the parsing of that program's original source text, even if the parsing
step has already been executed before by the REPL. Lastly, the entry point did
not allow for the evaluation in an existing context, a very important
requirement for the REPL. The new entry point therefore required a refactor, so
that firstly rules could be looked up and invoked individually in an existing
evaluation context, and secondly so that evaluation could be done on ASTs rather
than just program source text.

The refactoring consisted of separating parsing from evaluation and allowing all
of the rules to be accessed through Truffle's foreign object access
interface~\cite{Grimmer15}. These changes alone also allowed for invoking the
rules with an existing context. The changes were approved by the author of
DynSem, and have been integrated into the upstream repository.
