\subsubsection{Adding support for alternative evaluation strategies}
\label{ssec:discuss-alternate-eval}

As discussed in \cref{sec:eval-strat}, languages developed with Spoofax are not
limited to a single interpreter. Instead, there can be different strategies for
evaluation. While this has been taken into account for the design of the
product, only a DynSem evaluation strategy has actually been implemented.

Languages with a Java backend (such as IceDust%
\footnote{https://github.com/MetaBorgCube/IceDust}) therefore do not currently
work with the REPL. To add support for specific interpreters, a language should
provide the REPL with a named implementation of the
\texttt{``IEvaluationStrategy''}. The language designer can register alternative
evaluation strategies with the REPL by extending the Guice module of the backend
and overriding the \texttt{bindEvalStrategies} method.

Finally, the evaluation strategy that will be used to evaluate input terms can
be configured via the ShellFacet ESV extensions (see \cref{sec:esv-extensions})
as illustrated in \cref{lst:eval-method}.
