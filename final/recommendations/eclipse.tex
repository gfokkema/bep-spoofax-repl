The Eclipse frontend that is delivered with the product has been discussed in
\cref{ssec:eclipse-plugin}. The plugin provides interaction with the REPL
backend, as discussed in \cref{cha:design}.

The delivered Eclipse frontend is just that: a frontend to the REPL backend.
Integration with Eclipse and Spoofax Eclipse are not yet present. This
subsection provides several recommendations to better integrate this frontend
into Eclipse and Spoofax Eclipse.

\subsubsection{Building languages and projects}

TODO: write this when the discussion on classpath issues has been written.
Mention that there should be a button to build the language/project, put it on
the classpath and launch it in a REPL.

\subsubsection{Back and forth interaction between Eclipse and the REPL}

A feature the REPL does not yet support is loading existing files into the
evalution context (see \cref{ssec:discuss-repl}). When it does, this interaction
could provide deeper integration between the REPL and Spoofax Eclipse. For
example, hovering over variables could indicate from where they originate, or
changes in a currently loaded file could be automatically picked up. Changes in
the other direction are interesting, too: when a loaded function is overridden
inside the REPL, an option could be provided to apply this change to the loaded
file as well.

\subsubsection{Improving the UI of the Eclipse REPL}

The user interface currenty offered by the Eclipse frontend does not resemble a
typical REPL: the input and output views are separated. To improve the user
experience, these two views could be merged into one. TODO: expand and give
pointers as to how this might be possible?

TODO: recommend missed features such as autocompletion et cetera?
