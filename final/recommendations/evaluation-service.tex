\section{Integrating Evaluation with DynSem in Spoofax}
\label{sec:adding-an-eval}
Most of the execution steps as outlined in \cref{sec:spoofax} have a
corresponding API in Spoofax to provide programmatic access to those
aspects. For example, for parsing there exists a
\texttt{SyntaxService}. However, currently Spoofax lacks an
\texttt{EvaluationService} to perform evaluation with DynSem's generated
interpreters. Such an interface could hide the implementation details of Truffle
and class loaders (see \cref{sec:classpath}). Instead it can provide an API for
performing evaluations in context. The existing evaluation backend for DynSem
could then be adapted to use the \texttt{EvaluationService} instead.
