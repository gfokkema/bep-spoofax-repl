\chapter{Recommendations} \label{cha:recommendations}

This chapter makes several recommendations to the client for future work on the
delivered product. First, recommendations are made to improve the REPL backend
itself. Secondly, suggestions are made on how to improve the Eclipse frontend.
Finally, a recommendation is made to provide literate programming functionality.

desirable features have not been implemented. This subsection shortly highlights
