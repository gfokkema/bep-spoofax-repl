\section{The Spoofax Language Workbench}
\label{sec:spoofax}
Spoofax is a platform that allows for giving a completely \emph{declarative}
definition of a programming language and accompanying integrated development
environment (IDE) support~\cite{Kats10a}. Such a platform is called a
\emph{language workbench}.

In discussing programming languages, it is useful to distinguish the following
three concepts: an \textit{aspect} of a language, the formal
\textit{specification} of that aspect, and the actual \textit{implementation} of
that aspect, which follows from the specification. Any programming language can
be divided into multiple distinct aspects. In \cref{fig:spoofax-relations}, four
common aspects of programming languages are shown, along with the relation
between the formal specification and implementation for each aspect. An example
of an aspect is the \textit{syntax definition}: its formal specification is done
with grammar rules, and its implementation consists of both a tokenizer and
parser.

A key property of Spoofax is that it allows a language designer to give a
complete specification of each aspect of their language, and automatically
derives the implementations of those aspects from their respective
specifications. Spoofax provides a range of high-level, declarative
\textit{meta-languages} to declare language specifications.

This section goes over the aspects that come into play with the development of a
language and how Spoofax tackles each of these aspects with its
meta-languages. First, the section goes over some of the elements that make up
the specification of each language aspect\footnote{This section follows the
  structure of the language specification portion of the compiler construction
  course at the TU Delft. The slides can be found here:
  \url{http://tudelft-in4303.github.io/lectures/specification/}.}. A language
commonly consists of the following aspects, shown also in
\cref{fig:spoofax-relations}, of which a selection is discussed in more
detail throughout the rest of this section:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{\hyperref[ssec:syntax-def]{Syntax definition}:} The first aspect
  concerns what textual representations of a program are syntactically
  valid. Its specification consists of a grammar specified with context-free
  grammar productions. A parser provides an implementation of this
  specification, by mapping a textual representation of a program to an abstract
  syntax tree (AST) representation. In Spoofax, the syntax is declared with a
  domain specific language (DSL) called SDF.
\item \textbf{Static semantics:} A parsed AST then optionally goes through
  static analysis (type checking, name binding and variable scoping), to test if
  the program is well-formed. Static analysis is the implementation of an aspect
  called \textit{static semantics}. The static semantics of a language can be
  formally specified by \textit{type and/or name binding rules}. Spoofax
  provides two DSLs that can specify the two distinct parts of the
  specification: the TS Type Specification language and the NaBL name binding
  language.

  This language aspect is not discussed in this section. However, the
  original research report contains a section that does discuss this aspect. It
  can be found in \cref{ssec:a-static-analysis}.
\item \textbf{Term rewriting or program transformation:} Optionally, a
  well-formed AST can then be transformed, for example for desugaring or
  optimization. This execution step falls under the aspect of \textit{term
    rewriting} and can be formally specified by \textit{term rewrite rules}. For
  the specification of this aspect, Spoofax provides a DSL called Stratego.

  This aspect, too, is not discussed in this section. The relevant section
  from the research report can be found in \cref{ssec:a-term-rewrite}.
\item \textbf{\hyperref[ssec:dynamic-semantics]{Dynamic semantics}:} Next the
  optionally transformed AST is either compiled or interpreted, thereby
  providing a means of execution. The aspect of \textit{dynamic semantics}
  defines what the behavior is of a program upon execution. The formal
  specification of this aspect can be done with \textit{reduction rules},
  although there are other ways to accomplish this. For example, interpretation
  can be seen as the transformation of a program to a single value. In Spoofax,
  the dynamic semantics can be defined with either Stratego or a DSL called
  DynSem.
\end{enumerate}

This section concludes with a discussion on the other part of a language: its
IDE. Spoofax provides IDE support by means of its Editor Services.

\subsection{Syntax definition}
\label{ssec:syntax-def}
The first part of the specification of a language is its syntax. The
syntax of a language is often specified by means of a \emph{lexical
grammar} and a \emph{context-free grammar}, as can be seen in the
specification of, for example, Standard ML~\cite{Milner97}. The
lexical grammar is most often defined using regular expressions. It
defines the individual words made up of characters, such as
identifiers and numeric constants. The context-free grammar then
defines syntactically valid sentences made up of words.

\subsubsection{SDF3: syntax definition in Spoofax}
\label{ssec:orgheadline1}
To specify a syntax definition declaratively in Spoofax, a DSL called
\emph{SDF3}~\cite{Vollebregt12} is used.  SDF3 is the third generation
of the \emph{Syntax Definition Formalism} (SDF)~\cite{Heering89}. It
uses only context-free grammar productions for the specification of
both the lexical syntax and the context-free syntax, a feature that
was introduced in SDF2~\cite{Visser97}.

The declarative nature of SDF3 allows for thinking in terms of the
structure (the \emph{what}), instead of in terms of parser algorithms (the
\emph{how}) as is the case with many current parser generators such as
ANTLR and YACC~\cite{Kats10b}. The syntax definition is used to
make parsers that parse a textual representation of a program into its
AST and pretty-printers for mapping ASTs back to text. However, due to
its declarative nature, SDF3 is not limited to generating parsers and
pretty printers: it can also be used for error recovery
rules~\cite{deJonge12}, syntax highlighting rules and folding
rules for editors (see \cref{ssec:editor-serv}).

The Spoofax API gives access to the generated parser through the
\texttt{SyntaxService}. The results obtained by executing the parser results in,
among other information, an AST represented as an internal data structure. This
data structure is briefly highlighted in the following section.

\subsubsection{ASTs in Spoofax: Stratego terms}
\label{sec:asts-spoof-strat}
In Spoofax, an AST is represented as a Stratego term~\cite{Kats10a}. Terms in
Spoofax come with a textual format, ATerms, which is similar to formats such as
XML~\cite{Brand00}. As an example, a term representation of the arithmetic
expression $2 + 2 - 4$ is shown in \cref{lst:aterm-example}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={An example ATerm representation of an arithmetic
expression.},language=aterm,label={lst:aterm-example}]
Sub(Add(Int("2"), Int("2")), Int("4"))
\end{lstlisting}

Terms can however represent any tree structure, not just ASTs. For example, a
term may just as well represent a value. As such, when using Spoofax
programmatically through its API, one sees terms used as an internal
representation of the data going through the execution pipeline as depicted in
\cref{fig:spoofax-relations}.

\subsection{Dynamic semantics}
\label{ssec:dynamic-semantics}
Dynamic semantics refers to how a program written in some language
behaves~\cite{Winskel93}. There are many approaches to formally specify the
dynamic semantics of a programming language (for an extensive treatment, see
``\usebibentry{Winskel93}{title}''~\cite{Winskel93}). One way, for example, is
to specify the transformation of programs written in one programming language to
programs of another language of which the dynamic semantics are already known.

DynSem uses an approach called \textit{operational semantics}. The rest of this
section discusses how DynSem (and operational semantics) is used to specify the
dynamic semantics of a language in Spoofax.

\subsubsection{DynSem: rule-based dynamic semantics}
\label{ssec:dynsem}
Aside from Stratego, the Spoofax team has developed an additional method to
declare the dynamic semantics of a language, namely a DSL called
DynSem~\cite{VerguNV15}. DynSem allows for an operational semantics
specification from which a Java-based AST interpreter can be automatically
derived.

\paragraph{Reduction rules} In DynSem and operational semantics, reduction rules
are used to specify the dynamic semantics of a language. The syntax of a DynSem
specification is similar to the formal syntax as shown in
equation~(\ref{eq:formal-spec}). \Cref{lst:dynsem-rule-syntax} shows the syntax
of a reduction rule as specified in DynSem.
% NOTE: do _not_ change the above \ref to \cref, as it will render the label as
% figure. See the hack below for more info.

\begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=dynsem,numbers=left,caption={The syntactic structure
of a reduction rule in DynSem.},label={lst:dynsem-rule-syntax}]
  Rs |- <term1> :: RWs --> <term2> :: RWs'
  where <premise1>;
        <premise2>.
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

A reduction rule consists of a set of premises (lines 2 and 3) and a conclusion
(line 1). Put simply, the conclusion of a reduction rule holds if all of its
premises hold~\cite{Kahn87}. Thus, the rule shown in
\cref{lst:dynsem-rule-syntax} is read as follows: given that the premises
\textit{premise1} and \textit{premise2} hold, the conclusion in line 1 holds.

The left-hand side of the conclusion, the terms to the left of the arrow,
represents a pattern match on terms, matching variables that can be referenced
in other places of the rule. The right-hand side of the conclusion represents an
instantiation of terms, and is called the result of the
reduction~\cite{VerguNV15}.

\paragraph{Semantic components} The variables \texttt{Rs}, \texttt{RWs} and
\texttt{RWs'} shown in \cref{lst:dynsem-rule-syntax} are called \textit{semantic
  components}: they represent the context in which the reduction takes place. An
example of a semantic component is that of an environment, which maps variable
names to their values. Another example is that of a store, which maps addresses
of values to the values themselves. There are two kinds of semantic components:
\textit{read-only} semantic components and \textit{read-write} semantic
components. An environment is a read-only semantic component: a variable is
bound only within a certain scope, and any other reduction rules that are
applied outside of that scope do not see this environment. A store is a
read-write semantic component: changes in the store are visible everywhere, as
it represents mutable state.

\paragraph{Specifying function application in DynSem} An example of a reduction
rule specified in DynSem is shown in \cref{lst:dynsem}. The rule specifies the
semantics of function application by using an environment. Next to it, in
equation~(\ref{eq:formal-spec}), the same rule is shown in a formal syntax, to
highlight the similarity of DynSem's syntax with that of a formal one.

\end{minipage}

  \begin{equation*}
    \infer{%
      \left(\lambda x.e, E\right)~e_1 \longrightarrow v%
    }{%
      (x \mapsto e_1) \circ E \longrightarrow E' &\quad E' \vdash e \longrightarrow v
    }
  \end{equation*}
\end{minipage}
\\
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.47\textwidth}

  \captionof{figure}{The same rule in a formal specification. Here, the premises
  are shown on top.}\label{eq:formal-spec}
\end{minipage}
\end{minipage}

The rule first introduces a pattern-match on a term representing function
application on a closure (i.e. a function together with its enclosing
environment \texttt{E}). In line 4, the environment \texttt{E} (a semantic
component) is extended with a variable binding \texttt{x $\mapsto$ v1} to form a
new environment \texttt{E'}. Then, in line 5, the function body \texttt{e} is
reduced to the value \texttt{v2}, within the context of the newly extended
environment \texttt{E'}.

\subsection{Editor services}
\label{ssec:editor-serv}
This section concludes with a brief description of editor services,
which provide the IDE support for languages defined in
Spoofax. Examples of such services include an outline view, menus in
which one can bind actions to menu buttons (see
\cref{fig:menu-actions}), but also syntax highlighting, syntactic code
completion and code folding rules\footnote{More services are
listed on the Spoofax website:
\url{https://web.archive.org/http://www.metaborg.org/spoofax/editor-services/}}.

The Spoofax API provides the editor services with similar naming. For
example, the outline can be retrieved from the \texttt{OutlineService}, the
syntax highlighting can be accessed through the \texttt{StylerService} and
syntactic code completion is accessed with the
\texttt{CompletionService}. The defined menus for a particular language can
be retrieved with the \texttt{MenuService}, from which the menu actions can
be retrieved and used.

\begin{figure}[bt]

\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./img/menu-actions.png}
\caption{\label{fig:menu-actions}
A menu action for the paplj language defined using Spoofax. The bottom window shows the menu definition, the top window shows a program written in paplj.}
\end{figure}

Editor services are defined using a DSL called \textit{ESV}, shown in the bottom
window of \cref{fig:menu-actions}. In the case of menus, their actions are
specified using Stratego. Since Stratego supports native strategies, these
actions can also be specified in Java. As such, Spoofax allows for defining
arbitrarily complex IDE actions.

Many of these editor services such as syntax highlighting and code
folding rules can be derived from the syntax
definition~\cite{Kats10c} and can be further customized if
needed. Taken together with the language definition, the editor
services provide a language with a complete and state-of-the-art IDE
experience~\cite{Kats10a}.
