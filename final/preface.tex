\chapter{Preface and Acknowledgements}
\label{cha:preface-acks}

This report comprises the end of the TU Delft Computer Science Bachelor Project;
the final, compulsory project at the Delft University of Technology to attain
the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

The client during this project was the SLDE group at the TU Delft, who
\textit{``conduct research into concepts and techniques for programming language
design and implementation. The flagship product of the group is the Spoofax
Language Workbench''}. The Spoofax Language Workbench was to be extended with a
Read-Eval-Print Loop that would allow language designers and -users to
interactively work with the domain specific languages generated with Spoofax.

The purpose of this report is to describe the project as it was carried out over
the course of ten weeks. Not only does it describe the process, it also aims to
inform the reader about the problem and the design and implementation of the
solution to this problem. Finally, recommendations are made to the client to
improve the delivered product.
