\section{Problem Definition}
\label{sec:problem-definition}

In this section, the general problem of the client is defined in the
form of a question.

Spoofax offers a wide variety of tools to develop DSLs and accompanying IDE
support. Precisely because Spoofax is concerned with developing DSLs, rapid
prototyping of syntax and grammar is a convenient addition to the product.
\Cref{sec:repl} showed that REPLs provide this rapid prototyping
ability.  Therefore, the client has expressed their interest in a REPL that
works with languages designed with Spoofax. Such a REPL would aid both the
developer of the language and its end-user. The main problem, thus, is the
following:
