\subsection{Adding support for alternative evaluation strategies}
\label{sec:discuss-alternate-eval}

As discussed in \cref{sec:eval-strat} Spoofax languages are not limited to a
single interpreter, but there can be different strategies for evaluation.
While this has been taken into account for the design of the product, only
a DynSem evaluation strategy has been implemented in the product.

Languages with a Java backend, such as IceDust%
\footnote{https://github.com/MetaBorgCube/IceDust}, therefore do not currently
work with our REPL. To add support for specific interpreters, a language should
provide the REPL with a named implementation of the
\texttt{IEvaluationStrategy}. The language designer can register additional
evaluation strategies with the REPL by extending the Guice module of the core
project and overriding the \texttt{bindEvalStrategies} method.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=esv,caption={Setting the evaluation strategy},label={lst:eval-method}]
module editor/SL-Shell

shell
    evaluation method : "dynsem"
\end{lstlisting}

Finally, the evaluation strategy that will be used to evaluate input terms
can be configured via the ShellFacet ESV extensions as illustrated in \cref{lst:eval-method}.
