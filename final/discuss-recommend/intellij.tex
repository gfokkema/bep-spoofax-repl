\subsubsection{An IntelliJ Frontend}
\label{ssec:intellij}

As has been said before, an effort is currently underway to provide different
IDE-implementations of Spoofax. The Spoofax for IntelliJ IDEA
project\footnote{See:
\url{http://metaborg.org/en/latest/source/langdev/manual/env/intellij/}}
provides a plugin for the IntelliJ IDEA IDE. The client has expressed their
interest in having the REPL available in this IDE as well.

This IntelliJ IDEA REPL would then provide the same features as the current
console- and Eclipse REPLs.
