Another improvement is to extend the product with support for literate
programming, as discussed in \cref{sec:literate-programming}. This would allow 
for rapid prototyping and documentation at the same time~\cite{schulte2012},
allowing developers of new DSLs to document and explain their language in an
interactive manner that directly allows experimentation.
