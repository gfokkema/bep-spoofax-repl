\paragraph{Create a command-line shell interface for the Spoofax Language
Workbench}\mbox{}\\

From Spoofax's website:

\begin{quotation}
Spoofax is a platform for developing textual domain-specific languages with
full-featured Eclipse editor plugins.
\end{quotation}

A feature that Spoofax is lacking is a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL). A REPL is an
interactive programming environment that takes expressions, evaluates them and
prints their results. REPLs are a popular tool for programming because they
facilitate exploratory programming and debugging. Common examples include
command-line shells such as Bash and Python's REPL.

The deliverable for this project, then, is to create such a REPL for the Spoofax
Language Workbench.
