\chapter{Discussion and Recommendations}
\label{cha:disc-recomm}

In this chapter the achieved results are discussed, as well as some tasks that
have not been achieved. \Cref{cha:evaluation} already discussed how the final
product satisfied the client's requirements. This chapter goes more in-depth why
not all these requirements have been met.

Afterwards, some recommendations are made that will further enhance and provide
possible directions for future work on the product.

\section{Recommendations}
\label{sec:discuss-future}

This section makes several recommendations to the client for future work on the
delivered product. These recommendations come forth from requirements that have
not been implemented (see \cref{ssec:eval-requirements}) and opportunities for
improvements in the delivered product. First, recommendations are made to
improve the REPL backend itself. Secondly, suggestions are made on
how to improve the Eclipse frontend. Finally, recommendations to provide
additional frontend implementations are made.

\subsection{Extending the functionality of the REPL}
\label{ssec:impr-backend}

The delivered backend is a solid product. Due to time constrains, however, some
nice to have features have not been implemented. This subsection shortly
highlights these features.
