\chapter{Discussion and Recommendations}
\label{cha:disc-recomm}

In this chapter the achieved results are discussed, as well as some tasks that
have not been achieved. \Cref{cha:evaluation} already discussed how the final
product satisfied the client's requirements. This chapter goes more in-depth why
not all these requirements have been met.

Afterwards, some recommendations are made that will further enhance and provide
possible directions for future work on the product.
