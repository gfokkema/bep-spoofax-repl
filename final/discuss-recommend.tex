\chapter{Discussion and Recommendations}
\label{cha:disc-recomm}

In this chapter the achieved results will be discussed, as well as some tasks
that were not achieved. In \cref{cha:evaluation} we have already discussed how
our final product satisfied the customers requirements. Here it will be
discussed why not all these requirements have been met. Afterwards some
recommendations will be outlined regarding the changes that should be made to
both the REPL and to Spoofax in order to meet them. Finally some
recommendations regarding possible directions for future work will be given.
