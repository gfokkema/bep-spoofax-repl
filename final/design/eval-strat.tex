\section{Evaluation Strategies}
\label{sec:eval-strat}
As explained in \cref{sec:supp-diff-ways}, there are multiple ways for
specifying the dynamic semantics of a language. Interpretation can for example
be performed through an interpreter generated from a DynSem specification, or by
implementing the interpreter in Stratego or Java. However, in the end all of
these methods do the same thing, that is they accept an AST as input and somehow
transform it into an output. In Spoofax, both the input and the output can be
represented as a Stratego term. It is only the internal representation of the
evaluation context and the implementation of the interpreter that is different.

The Strategy pattern is useful for computation task that have the same types of
input and output, but a different implementation. As this is what is the case
for the different methods of evaluation, the method or ``strategy'' of
evaluation is therefore put behind an interface called
\texttt{``IEvaluationStrategy''}. \Cref{fig:uml-eval-strat} shows a UML diagram
of this part of the design.

An implementer of the \texttt{IEvaluationStrategy} is responsible for performing
execution on an AST representation of a program within the evaluation context
that it maintains throughout successive invocations. In this way, maintaining
the evaluation context is encapsulated, and no assumptions are made of what the
evaluation context looks like. This is a desirable property since the
representation of an evaluation context varies across languages and evaluation
methods.
